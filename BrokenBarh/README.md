# About The Project
Broken barh is a function in the matplotlib library that is used to create horizontal bar charts that represent discrete timescales.
This chart consist of horizontal bars with widhts and positions that match the specified time range.
Each bar represent a specific tiime interval or event. This function allows users to easily describe schedules. activities 
of proccess of varying duration in an intuitive visaul form

# What Does it do?
- Representing a span of time : The broken barh function can be used to easily represent different
  spans of time on a horizontal axis. This time span can represent specific events, occurances, or interval.
  These charts are especially useful in visualiziing data related to schedules, activites, or processes with
  varying durations.
- Displays horizontal bars: This function generates a horizontal bar chart with the width and position
  corresponding to the specified time range. Each bar represents a time interval and can be assigned a
  different color or style to distinguish different categories or attributes.
- Interaction with other elements : The broken barh diagram is easily combined with other visual elements
  in matplotlib for example, you can add x and y axes, labels, titles, and annotations to a bar
  chart. This allows you to create richer and informative visualizations by combining these diagrams with
  other elements such as timelines, text, or custom annotations.
