# What is 3DBarChart?
3D bar plot or a 3D column chart , is a type of visualization that represent data using rectangular bars spaces. It extends the concept
of a traditional 2D bar chart by adding an dimension. allowing for the visualization of three variables instead of just two. In a 3D bar chart, the length , width, and height of the bars represent different data values. The length and width typically correspond to two categorical variables. while the height represents a quantitative variable. Each bar in the chart represents a specific combination of the categorical variables, and the height of the bar corresponds to the magnitude of the quantitative variable. 
The primary purpose of 3D bar chart is to provide a visual representation
