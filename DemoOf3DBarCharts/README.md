# What is 3DBarChart?
3D bar plot or a 3D column chart , is a type of visualization that represent data using rectangular bars spaces. It extends the concept
of a traditional 2D bar chart by adding an dimension. allowing for the visualization of three variables instead of just two. In a 3D bar chart, the length , width, and height of the bars represent different data values. The length and width typically correspond to two categorical variables. while the height represents a quantitative variable. Each bar in the chart represents a specific combination of the categorical variables, and the height of the bar corresponds to the magnitude of the quantitative variable. 
The primary purpose of 3D bar chart is to provide a visual representation of the relationships between three variables in a datasets. It allows you to compare the values of different categories along two dimensions while also showing the magnitude of the quantitative variable

3D bar charts can be useful in various fields and applications , such as :
- Market research : Visualizing sales data accross different product categories and time periode
- Finance : Comparing financial performance of different companies across multiple years
- Science and engineering : Representing data from experiments or simulations involving multiple   independent variables.
