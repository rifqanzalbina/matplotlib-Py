# What is  Plotting the coherence of two signals?
Plotting the coherence of two signals is a visualization process using the matplotlib library to display the coherence 
between two signals Coherence measures the degree to which tow signals are related or correlated 
in the frequency domain. These coherence plots provide an understanding of the frequency relationship between 
two signals and can be used to analyze the relationship between the phenomena or events underlying the signals.

# What the functions of this graph?
- Visualization of frequency relationship : Coherence plots allow us to see the frequency relationship betweeen two
  signals . This helps in understanding whether there is a strong correlation between the frequency components between the tow
  signals or whether there is some pattern of realtedness.
- Identify the strenght of the correlation : Using a coherence plot, we can identify the strength of the correlation between two signals
  in various frequencies. A high coherence value indicates a strong correlation, While a low coherence value indicates a weak correlation
  or no correlation at all.
- Signal and analysis and data interpretation : Coherence plots help in data data analysis and interpretation in an intuitive way. By looking
  at coherence visualization, we can extract information about the relationship and interrelationship between two signals , which can be
  used to make decisions or draw conclusions in various contexts , such as signal processing data , data analysis , or system modelling .
