# What is StackedBarChart ?
In Matplotlib, a stacked bar chart is a type of chart that displays multiple datasets as stacked bars. It used to show the total
of each category and the contribution of individual components within each category. The stacked bar chart is particularly useful when
you want to compare the total value of different categories and understand the composition of each category in terms of its components. It
allows you to visualize the relationship between the whole and its parts 

The main use cases for a stacked bar chart include :
- Comparison of total values : You can compare the the total values of different categories by observing the overall height of each stacked
  bar . It provides a visual representation of the relative sizes of the categories
- Composition analysis : Stacked bar chart allow you to analyze the composition of each category by showing the contribution of different
  component or subcategories . The length of each component within a stacked bar chart indicates its proportionate value.
- Trend Visualization : Stacked bar charts can also be used to track changes over time or across different groups . By stacking bars
  representing different time periods or groups. you can observe the evolution of the total value and the contribution of each component.
- Data Storytelling : Stacked bar charts are useful for representing data in a visually appealing and informative way.
  They can be used in reports . presentation. or dashboards to communicate insights and findings effectively
