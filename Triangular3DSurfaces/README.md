# What is Triangular3DSurfaces?
- Triangular Mesh Generation : To create a Triangular3DSurfaces graph, a triangular mesh is generated over a specified domain or set
  of data points. This mesh consist of interconnected triangles that form a surfaces
- Data mapping : Each vertex of the triangular mesh is associated with a data point or a value of the dependent variable (Z), These data
  points could represent measurements, simulations, or any other relevant animation
