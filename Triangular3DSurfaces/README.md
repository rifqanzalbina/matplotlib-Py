# What is Triangular3DSurfaces?
- Triangular Mesh Generation : To create a Triangular3DSurfaces graph, a triangular mesh is generated over a specified domain or set
  of data points. This mesh consist of interconnected triangles that form a surfaces
- Data mapping : Each vertex of the triangular mesh is associated with a data point or a value of the dependent variable (Z), These data
  points could represent measurements, simulations, or any other relevant animation
- Interpolation : Interpolation techniques are employed to estimate values between data points on the triangular mesh. This allows for the creation of a smooth surface representation of the data
- Visualization : The resulting triangular mesh with interpolated values is visualized in a three-dimensional plot. The vertices of the triangles represent the X and Y coordinates , thus forming the surface
- Customization : The Triangular3DSurfaces graph can be further customized by applying color maps, shading, lighting, labels, and other visual enchancements to improve readability and convey additional information
